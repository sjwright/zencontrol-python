"""
High-level interface models and client.

This module contains models that belong to the zen_interface layer:
- ZenControl (main client for high-level usage)
- ZenLight, ZenGroup, ZenButton, etc. (high-level Pythonic objects)
- These objects use API-level concepts (ZenColour, ZenProfile) internally
- Business logic and convenience methods
