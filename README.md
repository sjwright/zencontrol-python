# py-zencontrol

This is an implementation of the Zencontrol TPI Advanced protocol in python. At this stage is has only been exposed to extremely basic testing with one zc-controller-pro sitting on one bench, connected to one light and one wall switch. It could also work for you, but I promise nothing.

Right now the API is mostly 1:1 with Zencontrol documentation but I'll probably end up changing stuff to make it more consistent. Expect method names to change. Expect tuples to be replaced with dicts, or dicts to be replaced with tuples. Assume nothing.

No "real" code has been developed yet using this implementation.

Supported:

* Most documented commands
* Multicast UDP event packets
* Packet checksums generated, tested and enforced
* Packet sequence counter maintained and enforced

Not yet supported:

* Unicast UDP event packets
* Event filters

Support not planned:

* Any commands involving DMX, Control4, or virtual instances
* Commands described in the documentation as "legacy"

## TPI errata

The following TPI Advanced commands are not working as documented:

* QUERY_DALI_COLOUR â€” This command is supposed to be able to return a light's current colour temperature, but right now it doesn't.

## TPI wishlist

The following is not possible with the current TPI Advanced

* Fetching the colour temperature setting defined for a scene (per the "colour scene assignment" section of Zen cloud)
* Event notification when a system variables changes
* Event notification for motion/light sensor lux level changes
